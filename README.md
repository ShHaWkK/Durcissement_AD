# Durcissement_AD
## Summary

Please paste the content of AD_Auto.ps1 or list its main actions so I can produce an accurate summary. Meanwhile, fill the template below to help me:

- Purpose: short one-line description of the script's goal.
- Main actions: bullets of commands/features (e.g., create users, modify groups, apply GPOs, change ACLs, generate reports).
- Scope/Targets: which OUs, groups, or domains are affected.
- Inputs/Parameters: files, credentials, switches the script requires.
- Outputs/Logs: reports, CSVs, event logs produced.
- Safety/Prerequisites: required permissions, test steps, rollback notes.

Once you provide the script or the filled template, I will write a concise English summary for the README.
